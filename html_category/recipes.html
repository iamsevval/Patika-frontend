    <h2><strong>How is Brownie Cookie Recipe Made?</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The eggs are taken into a flick of salt, sugar and vanillin whiskers. The color is whipped until it is
            opened. You can also do it with a mixer.</li>
        <li>Butter and chocolate are melted in a pan. Be careful not to burn. It is transferred into the mortar when it
            is warm. Other dry materials are also added and mixed. It will be like a dark brown cake.</li>
        <li>Then optional pieces of walnut and white chocolate are added. It adds a very nice flavor. You can also use
            chocolates if you want.</li>
        <li>Intermittently placed in the tray with an ice cream spoon or a tablespoon of greasy paper. We don't press on
            it. They will spread when cooking.</li>
        <li>In the preheated oven at the bottom upper setting is cooked at 175 degrees 14-15 min. Do not pass the time
            will harden. Served when warm or cold.</li>
    </ol>
